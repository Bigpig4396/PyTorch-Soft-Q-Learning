# PyTorch-Soft-Q-Learning

This is pytorch code for paper "Haarnoja, Tuomas, et al. "Reinforcement learning with deep energy-based policies." Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70. JMLR. org, 2017.
"

Dependencies are opencv-python, pytorch.

You may carefully adjust temperature parameter "alpha" in SoftQ class to get convergence. The code is short and easy to understand, you can try to apply to different problems
